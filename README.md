[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/HEAD)

## Getting Started

All of the materials for the 2021 Crops in Silico Hackathon can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon).

### Requirements

- Browser (tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Github Account

### Preparing for the hackathon

- Check that you can sign-in to Github, creating an account as necessary. We will be using Github Issues to track problems encountered during the hackathon.
- Try launching a mybinder instance by clicking on this [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/HEAD) icon (or the link below).

  It may take a few moments to initialize. If you encounter an error, open an issue and try with another browser. If you still cannot launch the binder, you can install the materials on your machine by following the instructions at one of the links below
  - [Local install (via conda)](https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/hackathon2021/setup.html#local-install)
  - [Docker container](https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/hackathon2021/setup.html#docker-container)

## Debugging Tips

#. If you are trying the MyBinder set up and are using a browser other than Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari, install one of those and try again.
#. If it is an error in a notebook cell, try restarting and running all of the cells (in case previous cells were missed).
#. Check for similar issues that have been reported as issues [here](https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues) including the issues that have been [closed](https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
#. If you are having issues with a local install, check [this page](https://cropsinsilico.github.io/yggdrasil/debugging.html) for known errors and their solutions.
#. If your issue has not been reported, open a new one [here](https://github.com/cropsinsilico/CiS2021-hackathon/issues/new).
